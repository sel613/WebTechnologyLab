              <h3>
                We create products that are unobtrusive and minimal. Here’s why:
              </h3>
              <p>
                As humans, we take on too much. It could be stuff, social
                obligations, work, clutter, etc. Ultimately there’s a cost to
                taking on too much – it takes away from our time, resources, and
                attention towards what truly matters to us. What’s important to
                you will differ from the next person. That’s what makes us all
                unique.
              </p>
              <h3>
                We believe that whatever you’re pursuing, be intentional about
                it.
              </h3>
              <p>What does that mean?</p>
              <h2>Being intentional is about</h2>
              <p>
                Being crystal clear on what is important to you Cutting out what
                isn’t important to you (the difficult part) Going after what you
                value with great vigilance It’s so easy to get wrapped up in
                trying to do everything and please everyone. It seems to make
                sense — say yes to as much as possible! This is a trap and a
                path to mediocrity. Instead, be thoughtful about what’s truly
                important to you (the less the better) and then focus on those
                with everything you have. Cut out everything else.
              </p>
              <h3>
                We've found that subtracting from your life is often the best
                way to accomplish more of what you want, and less of what you
                don’t.
              </h3>
              <h2>Less = more.</h2>
              <p>
                Doing less of what we don't enjoy, saying no more often, and
                limiting what we spend money on leaves us with more for the few
                things that really matter. This personal belief pours over into
                how we think about our products, design and processes.
              </p>
              <h3>We are the reflection of these beliefs.</h3>
